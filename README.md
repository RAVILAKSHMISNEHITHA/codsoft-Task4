## Overview of the Project

### Project: Sales Prediction Using Python

**Objective**: Build a predictive model to estimate Sales based on advertising spends (TV, Radio, Newspaper) to optimize marketing strategies.

**Key Activities**:
1. Load and explore the dataset.
2. Preprocess data by handling missing values and splitting into features (X) and target (y).
3. Train a Linear Regression model using training data.
4. Evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²).
5. Analyze feature importance and visualize actual vs predicted Sales.

**Technologies**:
- Libraries: 'pandas', 'numpy', 'scikit-learn', 'matplotlib', 'seaborn', 'scikit-learn'.
- Platform: Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook

**Key Insights**:
- TV and Radio advertising have the strongest impact on Sales.
- Feature analysis guides better budget allocation for maximum ROI.
- Achieved reliable predictions using regression techniques.
